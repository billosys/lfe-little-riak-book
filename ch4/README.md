# Chapter 4: Operators

<!-- What Riak is famous for is its simplicity to operate and stability at increasing scales. -->

In some ways, Riak is downright mundane in its role as the easiest
NoSQL database to operate. Want more servers? Add them. A network
cable is cut at 2am? Deal with it after a few more hours of
sleep. Understanding this integral part of your application stack is
still important, however, despite Riak's reliability.

We've covered the core concepts of Riak, and I've provided a taste of
how to use it, but there is more to the database than that. There are
details you should know if you plan on operating a Riak cluster of
your own.
