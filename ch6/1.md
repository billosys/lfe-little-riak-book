## A Short Note on RiakCS

*Riak CS* is Basho's open-source extension to Riak that allows your cluster to act as
a remote object storage mechanism, comparable to (and compatible with) Amazon's
S3. There are several reasons why you may want to host your own cloud storage mechanism
(security, legal reasons, you already own lots of hardware, cheaper at scale).
Riak CS is not covered in this short book, but I may certainly be bribed to
write one.
