## A Short Note on MDC

*MDC*, or Multi-Datacenter, is a commercial extension to Riak provided by Basho.
While the documentation is freely available, the source code is not. If you reach
a scale where keeping multiple Riak clusters in sync on a local or global scale is
necessary, I would recommend considering this option.
