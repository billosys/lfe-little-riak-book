## Wrap-up

Riak is a distributed data store with several additions to improve upon the
standard key-value lookups, like specifying replication values. Since values
in Riak are opaque, many of these methods either require custom code to
extract and give meaning to values, such as *MapReduce*m or allow for
header metadata to provide an added descriptive dimension to the object,
such as *secondary indexes* or *search*.

Next, we'll peek further under the hood and show you how to set up and manage
a cluster of your own.
